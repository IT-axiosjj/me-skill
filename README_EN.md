**A Claude Code skill for building a personal self-profile**

_Turn scattered notes, chat logs, and “this does not sound like me” corrections into a proper me profile._

_In short: it helps you sort out who you are, how you speak, and what kind of nonsense you would definitely never say._

## Install

### Install as a Claude Code skill

Copy the mirror directory into your Claude Code skills folder:

```text
.claude/skills/me-skill/
```

Or the global directory:

```text
~/.claude/skills/me-skill/
```

This repository already includes the mirror directory:

```text
.claude/skills/me-skill/
```

### Use as a local workflow

Clone the repository and run the Python scripts directly.

Requirements:

- Python 3
- standard library only in the current version

---

## Usage

### Quick start

Run the built-in sample:

```bash
python run_test_flow.py
```

### Generate your own me profile

#### Notes only

```bash
python run_test_flow.py --name my_me --notes path/to/notes.txt
```

#### Notes + chat

```bash
python run_test_flow.py --name my_me --notes path/to/notes.txt --chat path/to/chat.txt
```

#### Notes + chat + correction

```bash
python run_test_flow.py --name my_me --notes path/to/notes.txt --chat path/to/chat.txt --correction path/to/correction.txt
```

#### Multiple files

```bash
python run_test_flow.py --name my_me --notes notes_a.txt notes_b.md --chat chat_a.txt chat_b.md --correction correction.txt
```

### Material format

#### notes

Good for:

- self description
- diary excerpts
- preferences
- principles and boundaries

#### chat

Recommended format:

```text
Me: Let's define the problem first.
Friend: Your tone is direct, but not aggressive.
```

#### correction

Recommended format:

```text
Not like me: too emotional, too exaggerated, too preachy.
More like me: explain clearly first, then act.
I would not say: just rush in blindly.
```

### Output files

Generated files are written to:

- `selves/<slug>/records.json`
- `selves/<slug>/self.md`
- `selves/<slug>/persona.md`
- `selves/<slug>/profile.md`
- `selves/<slug>/versions/`

Where:

- `self.md`: facts, preferences, values, boundaries
- `persona.md`: style, emotion/attitude, decision tendencies, anti-patterns
- `profile.md`: final summary and simulation rules
- `records.json`: accumulated source materials
- `versions/`: automatic backups before updates

---

## Example

A typical output structure looks like this:

```text
selves/generated_case/
├── records.json
├── self.md
├── persona.md
├── profile.md
└── versions/
```

Where:

- `self.md` describes who you are
- `persona.md` describes how you speak
- `profile.md` describes how to simulate you

## Notes

- currently works best with txt / md text materials
- does not yet parse raw WeChat / QQ exports directly
- classification is heuristic, so manual review is recommended
- the current version is best viewed as a runnable MVP skill repository
